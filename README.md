### Description
This is a system which demonstrates how to use constructors and prototypes to collect information from users on a webpage where the users enter similar data, e.g. Their name(2)
their telephone number, their street of residence, their city and their state. All of them fill in similar fields and with constructors, they assist us in the back end to avoid
entering so much code to for each user, one constructor/prototype does the work in a single function which saves time for the programmer.

### Systems Used and Set-up Installation
